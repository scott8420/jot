// core::Shortcuts -- the SHORTCUT-REGISTRY paradigm: a key binding and the row
// that advertises it are ONE fact, declared once.
//
// The stone this carries: a shortcut has two consumers that must never disagree
// -- the wiring (set_accels_for_action) and the documentation (the shortcuts
// window). Declare them separately and they drift the first time a key changes;
// the app then lies to its user about its own keys. So the registry is the
// single source, and both consumers READ it: App wires from it, ShortcutsDialog
// renders from it. Add a shortcut in one place or it doesn't exist.
//
// It lives in core/ because it is GTK-FREE -- pure data plus string helpers
// (the two-layer seam: core knows nothing of widgets). That's what lets the
// selftest guard it headless: a pure test proves no two chords collide, which is
// a class of bug that otherwise only shows up as a mysteriously dead key.
//
// DOC-ONLY ROWS are half the point. Mouse gestures (drag, Ctrl+scroll) and keys
// a widget handles itself are not GActions and cannot be accelerators -- but a
// reader needs them just as much. A row with an empty `action` documents without
// binding, so the reference stays complete without lying to the accel table.
//
// (Adapted from Sudoku's registry, itself from Folio's s98. jot carries the
// shape, not the content -- these bindings are the seed's own.)
